This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common programming error: the ZeroDivisionError that occurs when trying to calculate the average of an empty list.  The initial code snippet exhibits the error, while a corrected version shows how to gracefully handle the empty list scenario to prevent the error.  The solution involves checking for an empty list before performing the division operation.
